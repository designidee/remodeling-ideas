<p>In this review we present an up-to-date summary of the research in cardiac tissue engineering with an emphasis on the design principles and selection criteria that have been used in two key technologies employed in tissue engineering 1 biomaterials technology for the creation of 3-D porous scaffolds which are used to support and guide the tissue formation from dissociated. This chapter comprises engineering aspects of bioreactor systems design operation scale-up developed or adapted for cultivation of mammalian cells such as bioreactors for suspension culture stirred-tank reactors bubble columns and air-lift reactors fixed bed and fluidized bed reactors hollow fiber and membrane reactors and finally disposable bioreactors. IMPORTANT ASPECTS FOR BIOREACTOR DESIGN With respect to tissue engineering bioreactors are used for different purposes such as i cell proliferation on a small scale e. Bioreactors for Tissue Engineering presents an overall picture of the current state of knowledge in the engineering of bioreactors for several tissue types bone cartilage vascular addresses the issue of mechanical conditioning of the.
