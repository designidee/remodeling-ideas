I find this odd because if the spring is broken Id expect both sides to be affected. After replacing the broken cable you should check the drum and cable on the other side of the door to make sure it hasnt come unwrapped while you were working. Youd need a ladder wrenches 38 716 and ½ winding bars vice grips and of course some handyman skills. What Should I Do If My Garage Door Cables Are Loose.</p>
