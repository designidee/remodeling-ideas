<p>The following report will detail background information regarding a cars cooling system a description of conceptual designs the final design process the test procedures and finally sample results produced via testing. Battery or Coil Ignition System Figure 42 shows line diagram of battery ignition system for a 4-cylinder petrol engine. Actually brakes use friction of brake shoes and drums to convert kinetic energy developed by the vehicle into heat energy. This is in fact a part of the reason for slowing down a vehicle. Enable power transmission at varied angles and varied lengths.</p>
<h3 id="however-the-reduction-of-no-by-the-co-or-hc-present-in-the-exhaust-is-a-much-faster-reaction-allowing-a-viable-reactor-design">However the reduction of NO by the CO or HC present in the exhaust is a much faster reaction allowing a viable reactor design.</h3><p>Actually brakes use friction of brake shoes and drums to convert kinetic energy developed by the vehicle into heat energy. It is this evolution that is the primary focus of this book. It mainly consists of a 6 or 12 volt battery ammeter ignition switch auto-transformer step up transformer contact breaker capacitor distributor. As such the design goal for the cooling system was not only to be a simple effective system but to become the cooling benchmark for the FSAE Electric Vehicle Team.
