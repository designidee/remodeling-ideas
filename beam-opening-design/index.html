<p>The design of concrete beam includes the estimation of cross section dimension and reinforcement area to resist applied loads. Concrete Beams with Openings. Tables 41 through 44 summarize the design sequence design equations and design aids that apply to steel beams with unreinforced openings. Even though large number of transverse openings with various shapes and sizes might employ but it is better to use circular shape to make rooms for service pipes for example electrical supply and plumping and using rectangular transverse opening through for.
