<p>In May 2018 the computer-aided design CAD software maker Autodesk announced the alliance with General Motors GM to explore the use of generative design and additive manufacturing AM in developing future vehicles 1. Generative design is a design exploration process where the designer designates performance goals required features keep outs and other optimizable parameters such as materials manufacturing methods and cost constraints into a machine learning algorithm. As you may know generative design is part of the family of Design for Additive Manufacturing DfAM techniques. Generative Design Additive Manufacturing Axis. Given that additive manufacturing enables a new level of design freedom it makes sense to use it for complex models that require a more flexible manufacturing method. This course introduces you to one of the more common applications of generative design.
