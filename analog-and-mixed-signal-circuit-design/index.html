<p>It begins with an introduction to the CMOS analog and mixed-signal circuit design with further coverage of basic devices such as the Metal-Oxide Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor MOSFET with both long- and short-channel operations photo devices fitting ratio etc. High CMOS volumes and the preference for digital-signal-processing methods motivate engineers to seek viable CMOS-SOC designs. This is increasingly important as these SoC processes are often strained to meet the analog and RF performance criteria due to relatively poor optimization for these domains. The Analog Port design team is well-versed in all aspects of Analog and mixed signal circuit design development porting and productization. Divided in the two parts Methodologies and Techniques recent theories synthesis techniques and design methodologies as well as new sizing approaches in the field of robust analog and mixed signal design automation are presented for.
