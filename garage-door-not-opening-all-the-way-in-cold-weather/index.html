<p>Hello This is a residential garage door I cant open the door using my fob. The problem I have been having during the past couple winters is that when the temperature gets frigid cold usually anything below 30 degrees F my garage door only opens about 10 inches and then stops. If youre still having problems then the cold temperatures may have caused the brackets that hold the runners for the garage door in place to become misaligned due to contraction of the metal in the cold weather. On the other hand if your opener is fairly new you may want to call a professional. When there is an issue with your safety sensors the opener will interpret this as an obstruction and refuse to close the door. This causes the door to lock up and struggle to open. My Garage Door Won T Close When It S Cold Action Garage Door.</p>
