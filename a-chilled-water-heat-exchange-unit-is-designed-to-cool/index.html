<p>Chilled water coil Fin type heat exchanger is adopted. - Carrier SmartVuTM Control system. Heat always flows from hot to cold. The Recirculating Chillers feature a compressor CFC-free refrigerant and a hot-gas by-pass valve. At the heart of the water chilled system a chiller removes heat from water by means of a refrigeration cycle. A refrigeration unit which uses electrical energy to produce a cold fluid and heat transfer coils which move cold fluid from the refrigeration unit to the target area and hot fluid from the target area to the refrigeration unit.

<p>Fixed Type Aqua Mini chillers capacity range is from 5kW to 16kW and they can freely combine with fan coil units. The la tter category includes water-to-water geothermal heat. Most manufacturers have a precise chw chilled water and cdw condenser water pressure drops across chillers evaporators and condensers for a maixum efficiency heat exchange chw temp givin off to refrigerant and heat being picked up by condenser water. The Aquaforce liquid chillers are designed to meet current and future compactness. Air-to Water Heat Exchangers are a very simple and reliable cooling andor heating option for smaller spaces with basic climate control needs.
