<p>It turns out that a chair conformation minimizes what are called transannular interactions in that each carbon on the ring as an axial hydrogen projecting out of the plane of the ring or an equatorial. Stability of conformation decided by many factors like angle strain- any deviation from normal bond angles. This energy difference is known as the A value and it varies depending on the axial group. The chair conformation is the most stable conformer. Usually chair conformation is the most stable conformation and at room temperature about 9999 of cyclohexane in a mixture of different conformation exists in this conformation.</p>
<h3 id="cyclohexane-has-two-limiting-conformations-the-chair-and-the-boat">Cyclohexane has two limiting conformations the chair and the boat.</h3><p>The chair conformation is the most stable conformer. A chair conformation is one of many conformations of a cyclohexane ring and it is most stable. For this class we will always find that the most stable conformation is staggered ie 1 3 or 5 and the least stable is eclipsed ie 2 4 or 6. Thus 3 and 5 are both equally stable and they are the most stable conformations for 2-methylbutane. Torsional strain- a pair of tetrahedral carbons attached to each other have their bond staggered.</p>

<p>This energy difference is known as the A value and it varies depending on the axial group. I n chair cyclohexane there are two types of positions axial and equatorial. The answer is because of the torsional and steric strains which are more present in a boat conformation. The chair conformation that you have drawn 4 C 1 is likely to be the most stable one as it minimizes the number of heavy axial groupsTo determine the chair conformation of a hexose it is generally easiest to draw it and compare it with β-D-glucose where all heavy groups are equatorial and the conformation is 4 C 1If the number of heavy axial groups becomes smaller when the conformation. The chair conformation is the most stable conformation of cyclohexane. Cyclohexane and the natural bond angles of C C and C H add a great deal of flexibility to the ring.

However why chair is more stable than boat. So the stability increases from Half chair to boat to twist boat and finally the chair conformation.

<p>The minimum energy conformation of your example is shown below. Chair conformation of cyclohexane is more stable than boat form because in chair conformaion the C-H bonds are equally axial and equatorial ie out of twelve C-H bonds six are axial and six are equatorial and each carbon has one axial and one equatorial C-H bond. The answer is because of the torsional and steric strains which are more present in a boat conformation. This too is almost free of angle strain but in contrast has torsional strain associated with eclipsed bonds at the four of the C atoms that form the side of the boat. Due to this reason chair conformation is stable than boat conformation. So the equatorial conformation is more stable than the axial by 728 kJmol. Cyclohexane Conformational Analysis.</p>

<p>The answer is because of the torsional and steric strains which are more present in a boat conformation. Chair conformation of cyclohexane each carbon atom has one axial and one equatorial hydrogen atom correctly describes the the bond angles are near 1095 correctly describes the. The equatorial bonds e are perpendicular to the axis of the ring while axial bonds a are parallel to the axis of the ring. In both conformations chair and boat the bond angle is 1095 which eliminates the angular strain in the cyclohexane structure. So the stability increases from Half chair to boat to twist boat and finally the chair conformation. The minimum energy conformation of your example is shown below.

<p>Due to this reason chair conformation is stable than boat conformation. This energy difference is known as the A value and it varies depending on the axial group. Stability of conformation decided by many factors like angle strain- any deviation from normal bond angles. Of these two positions of the Hs the equitorial form will be the most stable because the hydrogen atoms or perhaps the. Due to this reason chair conformation is stable than boat conformation. It turns out that a chair conformation minimizes what are called transannular interactions in that each carbon on the ring as an axial hydrogen projecting out of the plane of the ring or an equatorial. Cyclohexane Chair Conformation Stability Which One Is Lower Energy.</p>

<p>I ran a few simple calculations molecular mechanics followed by DFT optimisation - gas phase on the axial and equatorial conformations which showed that the two conformations are separated by around 34 kcalmol. The larger the group the higher the energy difference. Just so you guys know 23 kilojoules per mole is a large number in. Draw the second chair conformation ring-flip-check this post if not sure. Comparing 1 3 and 5 we see that 1 has two bad gauche interactions whereas 3 and 5 have only one gauche interaction. Due to this reason chair conformation is stable than boat conformation.

<p>Firstly Newman projections along either of the horizontal C-C bonds in the boat form show eclipsing and secondly the two hydrogens shown the socalled bowsprit hydrogens come within such a short distance of one another that a repulsive force. Besides boat conformation tends to convert into the boat-twist conformation. It turns out that a chair conformation minimizes what are called transannular interactions in that each carbon on the ring as an axial hydrogen projecting out of the plane of the ring or an equatorial. Thus 3 and 5 are both equally stable and they are the most stable conformations for 2-methylbutane. As you can see as the groups get bigger ethyl tertbutyl these values start to get really crazy high. At 25 C 9999 of all molecules in a cyclohexane solution adopt this conformation.
