<p>Your air conditioning bills will sky rocket. At the very least disrupting the flow of air causes the ac unit to work harder to compensate for imbalance of air pressure throughout the house. It may seem that going through your living spaces and opening doors will add a few more minutes to our often frantic leaving-the-house routine. If you dont have windows in your garage another option is to leave the garage door open for a few hours when you want to lower the temperature. The cost to do this is free. Even if your home is not air-conditioned leaving the attic door open will warm up your home. Mid Century Modern Ranch House Exterior Modern Garage Doors Mid Century Modern Exterior.</p>

Leaving Garage Door Open Keep House Cooler. Still if you are spending considerable time in the garage and treating it as another room of the house it makes complete sense to have an air conditioner in there. Leaving the door open would also cool down space next to the garage within the home. Some garage doors have vents in them but cracking the garage door relieves some of the heat.
